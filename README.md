# 🌱 Motiv8 – Growth, Together

**Motiv8** is an open-source, nonprofit social app that helps users stay committed to their daily tasks, routines, and personal goals. Without pressure or perfection, but through **accountability, realness, and community**.

Unlike traditional social media, Motiv8 is built for **growth**, not comparison or virality. It’s a calm, judgment-free space where users can:
- Share their tasks, goals, and daily habits
- Join others on shared routines (e.g. workouts, cooking, studying)
- Hold each other accountable
- Support each other using positive messages
- Learn from one another’s journeys, not their highlight reels

## ✨ Vision

> A social platform where people connect not for likes or clout, but to become better, together.

Motiv8 is for:
- People trying to stay consistent with personal goals
- Friends who want to grow and hold each other accountable
- Anyone tired of performative apps that make them feel “less than”
- People who want to **share their process**, not just their results

## 🔄 Current Status

This is an early-stage project under active development.  
We are building toward an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focused on **task sharing, accountability, and safe community motivation**.
