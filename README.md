# 🌱 Motiv8 – Growth, Together

**Motiv8** is an open-source, nonprofit social app that helps users stay committed to their daily tasks, routines, and personal goals. Without pressure or perfection, but through **accountability, realness, and community**.

Unlike traditional social media, Motiv8 is built for **growth**, not comparison or virality. It’s a calm, judgment-free space where users can:
- Share their tasks, goals, and daily habits
- Join others on shared routines (e.g. workouts, cooking, studying)
- Hold each other accountable
- Support each other using encouraging messages
- Learn from one another’s journeys, not their highlight reels

---

## ✨ Vision

> A social platform where people connect not for likes or clout, but to become better, together.

Motiv8 is for:
- People trying to stay consistent with personal goals
- Friends who want to grow and hold each other accountable
- Anyone tired of performative apps that make them feel “less than”
- People who want to **share their process**, not just their results

## 🔄 Current Status

This is an early-stage project under active development.  
We are building toward an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) focused on **task sharing, accountability, and safe community motivation**.

---

## 🚀 Rollout Plan

Motiv8 is built **intentionally and in phases**, prioritizing clarity, depth, and human-centered design over feature volume or engagement tactics.

### **Phase 1 — Foundation (MVP)**
**Focus:** Daily direction & personal consistency  

- 📅 **Today View**  
  - Direction reminder (goals, habits, values)  
  - Frictionless task execution  
  - End-of-day closing ritual (summary, reflection, mood)
- 🌱 **Growth Space**  
  - Goals as paths with milestones  
  - Habit & streak tracking  
  - Routines as repeatable systems
  - Personal growth insights
- ➕ **Add Action Flow**  
  - Quick creation of tasks, habits, routines  
  - Everything linkable to goals

**Goal:** Help users feel grounded, intentional, and in control of *today*.

### **Phase 2 — Reflection Intelligence (Opt-in)**
**Focus:** Understanding patterns & improving systems  

- Weekly & monthly insights
- Habit, mood, and energy pattern detection
- Gentle system improvement suggestions
- Optional AI guidance (private, non-comparative)

**Goal:** Turn awareness into understanding — without pressure.

---

### **Phase 3 — Community & Inspiration**
**Focus:** Motivation through shared growth  

- Community feed (shared routines, joinable tasks, systems)
- Encouragement over reactions
- No rankings or performance comparison

**Goal:** Inspire and support — never compete.

---

### **Phase 4 — Profiles as Personal Paths**
**Focus:** Identity, story, direction

- Shared systems, values, and reflections
- No public follower metrics

**Goal:** Connection through authenticity.

---

### **Phase 5 — Sustainability**
**Focus:** Long-term health
